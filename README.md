# Lab4-MobilePlatformAndProgramming
Fourth laboratory project for the curriculum Mobile Platforms And Programming at FCSE. The goal of the exercise was to create a simple android app will use the Firebase service from Google.
In the application implemented is a standard user authentication (using username and password) using a realtime database form the Firebase service where users can enter their info to be saved into the database and a secondfragment which isn't working perfectly to display the previous users in the database.
